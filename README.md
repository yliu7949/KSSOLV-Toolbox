**KSSOLV Toolbox** is a MATLAB-based graphical tool designed to make running density functional theory (DFT) calculations provided by the **Kohn-Sham Solver (KSSOLV)** package easier and more intuitive. It helps researchers avoid writing complex scripts and instead complete the full workflow—from structure import and calculation setup to post-analysis—through a user-friendly interface.

## Key Features

**KSSOLV Toolbox** adopts a modular design:

* **Preprocessing Module**: Import crystal structures and analyze symmetry.  
* **Computation Module**: Supports SCF and Non-SCF calculation tasks.  
* **Post-processing Module**: Computes and processes results such as band structures.  
* **Visualization Module**: Provides built-in plotting templates for quickly visualizing results.

## Installation

The toolbox works directly in MATLAB® Desktop on Windows, macOS, and Linux:
